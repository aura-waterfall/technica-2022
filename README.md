#  An Automated Assistant for Course Management
A Python algorithm that utilizes Z3-Solver to automatically assign the appropriate time slot and location for a given course

## Current progress  üèÉ
- [x] Add in code to read input from a file instead of editing the program
- [x] Add in code to schedule classes in different days (MWF or TT) and durations (50-minute intervals on MWF or 75-minute intervals in TT)
- [x] Increase the parameters to include professor who will teach the course
- [x] Add in code to make separate schedules for lectures and discussions
- [] Add in code to prevent putting small classes in big lecture halls

## What's next  üß©
- Add in code to schedule time slots for longer courses (i.e. labs that are over 75 minutes long)
- Add in code to schedule other day patterns (i.e. Monday and Wednesday, any other day)
- Add in code to prevent putting small classes in big lecture halls
- Add in code to allow multiple lectures and multiple discussions for one class to happen at different classes and buildings
- Add in a Professor class to account for professor's time and location preferences

## Technologies used so far  üõ†Ô∏è
- Google Colab
